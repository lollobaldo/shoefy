        <h2 id="team-management" style="padding-top: 2%;">1. Team Organization</h2>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> 1.2. Weekly meetings and communication </h3>
        <p>The weekly meetings with our supervisor, Elena, were the main ways for the whole team to discuss the progress made so far. During the meeting, we discussed what we've done so far and our mentor gave us valuable feedback on what we could improve. Then, at the end of each session, we discussed any potential changes to our plan and assigned weekly tasks for all members. We had a very strict schedule for those meetings as we were in different timezones. </p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> 1.3. Communication software used </h3>
        <h4> 1.3.1. Microsoft Teams </h4>
        <p> Microsoft Teams was our main platform for verbal communication. This was the place where we met weekly and where we had our demo reviewes. Since we were divided into different sub-groups in each Milestone, we decided that it would be best for each group to use their preferred way of communication - that's why we also had a Messanger chat and Discord server, however, when we had to all meet together we always used teams in order to keep track of each meeting and record the more important ones.</p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> 1.3.2. Discord </h4>
        <p> Discord was our main way of communication between each subteam mostly because the voice and chat channels are easily adaptable to any changes. Also, we were able to structure the information in an easy to track way as we had different channels for each sub-team. This significantly improved our report writing as we could simply follow the chat log on Discord and evaluate what we've done for this demo. Finally, we had a channel for memes and games which was mainly used for fun and team building. </p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> 1.3.3. Facebook Messenger </h4>
        <p> This was our emergency chat - if something had to be done as soon as possible we would call the group on Messenger or pin someone in the chat which would send a notification on their mobile phone. </p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> 1.3.4. Trello </h4>
        <p> For software project management we used a Trello board. This way people from each sub-team were able to track what still needs to be done and what tasks were already completed.</p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> 1.4. Version control </h3>
        <p> We decided to use GitHub for version control as most people were familiar with it. This way everyone had access to the code at any given time and we could also use all the features provided by the platform. A link to our repository could be found at the bottom of each page. We've used one single repository for the project as we transitioned people quite often between the different sub-teams. For our reports we used Overleaf as it gives us the opportunity to redact the files at the same time.</p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 2%;"> 2. Team management and sub-teams </h2>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>2.1. Team distribution</h3>
        <p> Since our project has several easily identifiable parts which were discussed with Gary during the first feasibility workshop, we've decided to split the team into sub-teams. Those smaller teams were constantly changing - whenever we decided that a specific task requires more attention, more people were assigned to it. We used the reverse practice as well - if team members completed their specific tasks earlier they joined in one of the sub-teams which was in need of help. </p>
        <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>2.2. Initial Milestone plan and task distribution</h3>
        <p> These were our initial Milestone tasks which were in our project plan. You can follow down where we've derived from the expectations as we've given a brief description of the actual tasks. </p>

        <h3>2.3. Milestones and sub-teams</h3>
        <h4>2.3.1. Milestone 1</h4>
        <img src="images/milestone1.jpg">
        <p class="milestone-info">Our goals for the first demo
          were mostly focused on integrating some basic functionality
          in our systems and also settling on a specific design of our
          robot. We’ve managed to fully achieve most of our goals
          except some parts of the design of our robot. We were
          intending to also implement the lifting part in WeBots but
          we underestimated how complicated this task would be so we had to push it to the next one. </p>
        <p><b>The simulation </b> team was working
          on the design of the robot and implementing the basic
          functionality in WeBots while <b>software team </b> worked on
          the booking App - its user interface and back-end.</p>
          <p class="new-line">&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>2.3.2. Milestone 2</h4>
          <img src="images/milestone2.jpg">
          <p class="milestone-info">In the previous demo, we encountered problems with the lifting
            system, which we completed this time. The task was a bit
            more advanced than we had anticipated, but we tackled it
            without major problems with the additional time we had
            since the previous demo.
            Further, for this milestone, we aimed for having a system
            to pull the boxes from the shelves and onto the platform,
            which we achieved flawlessly.
            After a discussion within the group and our mentor, we decided the integration of a payment system was less relevant
            to the development of the project, and we therefore chose
            to defer it to the previous milestone. <b>The navigation team</b> was responsible for the robot being able to navigate around objects and also design the environment in which it would operate while <b>the hardware team</b> was working on fully designing a robot that would be operational in the real world. </p>
